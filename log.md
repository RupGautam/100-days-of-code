# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 24 July, 2017 (Project 1)
**Today Progress**: Worked on temperature conversion, which takes the temperature(Fahrenheit) and converts into
 Celsius and Kelvin. 

**Thoughts:** Simply converting °F to °C and °K is really simple but using method and classes make it little difficult. 

**Link to work:** [Temperature Conversion](src/Temperature.java)

### Day 1: 25th July, 2017 (Project 2)
**Today Progress**: Created Java program to count vowels(upper cases, lower cases and non-vowel) from given String. 
**Thoughts** It was really simple. Non-vowel didn't work beacuse I was trying to count non-vowel inside vowels if-statement. 

**Line to work:** [vowel Count](src/CountVowels.java)
