# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 24 July, 2017 (Project 1)
**Today Progress**: Worked on temperature conversion, which takes the temperature(Fahrenheit) and converts into
 Celsius and Kelvin. 

**Thoughts:** Simply converting °F to °C and °K is really simple but using method and classes make it little difficult. 

**Link to work:** [Temperature Conversion](src/Temperature.java)

### Day 1: 25th July, 2017 (Project 2)
**Today Progress**: Created Java program to count vowels(upper cases, lower cases and non-vowel) from given String. 
**Thoughts** It was really simple. Non-vowel didn't work beacuse I was trying to count non-vowel inside vowels if-statement. 

**Line to work:** [vowel Count](src/CountVowels.java)

### Day 2: 26th July, 2017 (Project 3)
**Today Progress**: Program that asks user for 7 different temperature and present them with 
 average temperature. 
**Thoughts** This project would have been easy, if I just do it without Array but
using Array makes it tricky.

**Line to work:** [vowel Count](src/enhancedForArray.java)

### Day 3: 27th July, 2017 (Project 4)
**Today Progress**: Starting learing 2Darrays, it's hard. getting to know better. 
**Thoughts** Hard but fun. I think I need to do this more. The 2d thing.
