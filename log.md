# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 24 July, 2017 (Project 1)
**Today Progress**: Worked on temperature conversion, which takes the temperature(Fahrenheit) and converts into
 Celsius and Kelvin. 

**Thoughts:** Simply converting °F to °C and °K is really simple but using method and classes make it little difficult.
